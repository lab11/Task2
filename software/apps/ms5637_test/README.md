MS5637 Temperature/Pressure Test
===============

Test basic functions of the temperature/pressure sensor.

This app reads and prints the temperature and pressure every 5 seconds.

RTT output (`make rtt`) should be similar to:
```
TEMP/PRESSURE TEST
temperature: 21.370001, pressure: 999.419983
temperature: 21.379999, pressure: 999.530029
temperature: 21.379999, pressure: 999.419983
...
```
