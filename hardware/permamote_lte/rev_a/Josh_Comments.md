- R15 is strange, double check with reference schematic
- add label to nrf9xxx? part
- remove text that says nrf52840
- label schematic pages with function
- what's the enable pin on the nrf? is there ever a time when you want it off?
- give the nrf a name
- if this is transmitting cellular it needs a much bigger cap on vdd
- I would pick a sim card holder with a detection line...we should probably do that on Neha's board too
- I don't see an LED in the schematic - you should add one, probably tricolo
- I would route the RST line from the ambique to the nrf's actual reset not just a GPIO pin so that it's watchdog functionality works properly
- Also the JLINK definitely needs to be connected to nRESET on the NRF
- What was LBST supposed to connect to?...Oh I see. You should switch it to a label in a box. I'm not sure it's actually connected the way it is.
    - Are VSOL, VSEC and VBAT connected how you expect?
- Do you need two antennas for the GPS? I would just go with a board mount patch antenna
    - Also putting antennas in series like that can have weird RF performance
- Does VIO need to be connected?
- Does IO Supply need to be connected to more than a cap?
